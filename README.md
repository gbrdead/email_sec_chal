# E-mail security CTF challenge

This is the source code for a capture-the-flag challenge that tests the player's ability to use PGP for secure e-mail communication.

The challenge is running [here](https://ctf.voidland.org/email_sec_chal/). You are free to test your knowledge and abilities.

If you don't have any upfront knowledge about secure communication via e-mail - don't worry, there is a lecture on the matter you can read. You will have to learn the PGP specifics yourself.

The only way to validate a flag is to send it to the author of the challenge (gbr@voidland.org). I will manually check the flag and I will respond with the points you have earned. Do not assume that if something looks like a flag then it would give you the points.

Of course, the source code contains spoilers. Of course, the challenge author will be able to see your communication with the bot - use a burner e-mail address if necessary.
